Section 1 - Copyright Ownership of Works Created by U.S. Federal
Employees

This repository contains both the original software for OpenFisca
Country-Template (the "Program", as defined in Section 0 of the GNU
Affero General Public License) and software modifications made by the
General Services Administration (GSA). This repository combines the
Program and these GSA modifications into a piece of software called
"Prototype: OpenFisca Web API for USA Head Start Program", which is a
"Modified Version" of OpenFisca Country-Template.

As a work of the United States Government, the software modifications
made by GSA are not subject to copyright within the United States.
Additionally, GSA waives copyright and related rights in its software
modifications worldwide through the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain
Dedication (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The Program (as defined in the GNU Affero General Public License)
remains subject to copyright under the GNU Affero General Public
License.

This Modified Version ("Prototype: OpenFisca Web API for USA Head Start
Program") contains both software under the GNU Affero General Public
License and software modifications by GSA released as CC0. It is a
"joint work" made of the original software and modifications combined
into a single work.

Section 2 - Trademark

GSA owns, reserves, and retains all rights, title, and interest in all
trademarks owned by GSA. The User does not acquire any right or interest
of any kind in any GSA trademark because of their use of the Modified
Version or any of the modifications made to the Program by GSA.
